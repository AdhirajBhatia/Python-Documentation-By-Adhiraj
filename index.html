        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is a recent, general-purpose and high level programming language.</li>
            <li>It is available for free.</li>
            <li>It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released released in 1991.</li>
            <li>He named it after the television comedy show Monty Python's Flying Circus.</li>
            <li>The code can be run on multiple platforms(operating systems).</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3 id="Installing Python">Installing Python</h3>
        <p>To install Python, you must first download the installation package of the required version (3.8.2) from the
            link given below
            <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>. Double click the file to
            install it.

            <li>Cross platform language .</li>

        <h3>In Python, there are two modes for running code:</h3>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interactive mode (Python Shell)</li>
            <li>Script mode</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3 id="Interactive mode –">Interactive mode –</h3>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is handy when you just want to execute basic Python commands.</li>
            <li>The “&gt;&gt;&gt;” is the prompt used in the Python interactive mode which indicates that the prompt is
                waiting for
                us to give a command.</li>
            <li>The result is immediately displayed on the Python shell as soon as you type them and hit the enter key.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3 id="Pros and Cons of Script Mode :">Pros and Cons of Script Mode :</h3>
        <p>The following are the advantages of running your code in script mode:<br></p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is easy to run large pieces of code.</li>
            <li>Editing your script is easier in script mode.</li>
            <li>Good for both beginners and experts.</li>
        </ul>The following are the disadvantages of using the script mode:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Can be tedious when you need to run only a single or a few lines of code.</li>
            <li>You must create and save a file before executing your code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3 id="Key Differences Between Interactive and Script Mode">Key Differences Between Interactive and Script Mode
        </h3>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>In script mode, a file must be created and saved before executing the code to get results. In
                interactive mode, the result is returned immediately after pressing the enter key.</li>
            <li>In script mode, you are provided with a direct way of editing your code. This is not possible in
                interactive mode.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3 id="Variables">Variables</h3>
        <p>A variable is a reserved memory location to store values.</p>
        <h3 id="Rules For Naming A Variable">Rules For Naming A Variable</h3>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>It should not start with a number but it can be followed by a number. Eg. Sub1, Sub2</li>
            <li>Space, dot and hyphen are not allowed between a variable name. But underscore is allowed. Eg Sub_1</li>
            <li>Variable name is case sensitive. ‘a’ and ‘A’ are two different variables.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3 id="Some invalid variables">Some invalid variables</h3>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1num - As it is starting with a number</li>
            <li>Num 1 - As there is a space in between</li>
            <li>S.P - As there is dot in between</li>
            <li>F-name - as there is hyphen in between</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3 id="Comments">Comments</h3>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comment- It is used to tell us about the code</li>
            <li>A comment line starts with # (hash)</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3 id="Operators">Operators</h3>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                + (Addition) - Adds two operands.</li>
            <li>- (Subtraction) - Subtracts two operands.</li>
            <li>* (Multiplication) - Multiplies two operands.</li>
            <li>/ (Division) - Divides the first operand by the second.</li>
            <li>// (Floor Division) - Divides the first operand by the second.</li>
            <li>% (Modulus) - Returns the remainder when first operand is divided by the second.</li>
            <li>** (Exponent) - Returns first raised to power second
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3 id="Id()">Id()</h3>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python id() function returns the “identity” of the object.</li>
            <li>id() is an inbuilt function in Python.</li>
            <li>An Id is a memory address of each object.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3 id="Tokens">Tokens</h3>
        <p>The smallest element of a Python program is known as Token.<br>Some Of The Parts Of Tokens Are As
            Follows:<br></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keywords</li>
            <li>Identifiers</li>
            <li>Literals</li>
            <li>Operators</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Keywords</h4>
        <p>Keywords are the reserved words of Python that have a special fixed meaning for the interpreter.Commonly used
            key words are True, False, break, continue, print, import, continue etc.</p>
        <h4>Identifiers</h4>
        <p>Identifiers are names given to the variables, constant, function or module. A keyword cannot be used as an
            identifier.<br>Valid examples of indentifiers- ABC, Num_1, num1</p>
        <h4>Literals</h4>
        <p>A fixed numeric or non-numeric value is called a literal.<br>Examples – 2, -23.6, “MCS” , ‘Class 8’</p>
        <h4>Operators</h4>
        <p>A symbol or a word that performs some kind of operation on given values and returns the result.<br>Examples
            are: +, -, **, *</p>
        <h3 id="Python is case sensitive">Python is case sensitive</h3>
        <p>It means you have to take care whether you are naming the variables with capital letters or small letters.
